#
# WTFamily config for production (no hot reload, optimized)
#
version: '3'

# TODO: use variables
#
# Questions:
# - exposing both FE and BE to outer world
#   - different ports? (current solution)
#   - nginx wrapper w/routing?
#     - then FE/BE containers are not directly accessible but via different
#       mount points on nginx

services:
  # TODO: NOT LIKE THIS! the idea is that an ephemeral container acts
  #       as the CLI for the WTFamily service, approximately like this:
  #       https://preslav.me/2019/03/18/using-ephemeral-docker-containers-as-cli-applications/
  #       However, it doesn't make sense to launch it via docker-compose.
  #       For now we just import the GrampsXML file every time on build, which
  #       doesn't make sense either in long term.
